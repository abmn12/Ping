# Ping
This was my first ever python project
It is basically a python GUI program in which I have used a package from python called tkinter and tried to create a game. 

The game is named Ping Pong inspired by the first ever 2D game created for computers. 
The screen when game launches up has 2 paddles on its left nad right which can be controlled by keys on the keyboard. And the ball moves around.
